hi, testing

1) download git, nodejs

2) git clone "https://github.com/Keith-JK/CS2102" (get the git repo)

3) cd App/

4) run npm install (install any package needed)

to test: (while in App/)

npm start (you'll need to remove the line in app.js that says app.listen())

npm test (this version auto restarts server for any changes)
