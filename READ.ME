hi, testing

1) download git, nodejs

2) git clone "httplink" (get the git repo)

3) run npm install (install any package needed)

to test:

npm start (you'll need to remove the line in app.js that says app.listen())

npm test (this version auto restarts server for any changes)

4) use index.ejs as the template for any future pages
